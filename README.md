Pocket Prediction (from MD trajecotries) 
This repository provides a Python script to identify and extract protein binding pockets from molecular dynamics trajectories. The script uses fpocket, a powerful tool for pocket detection, which must be pre-installed.
The trajectory files are processed to identify potential pockets in each frame, outputting pocket coordinates and associated metadata.

Whats included: 
- Pocket idnetifier scripts - main.ipynb 
- Regression script that analyses pocket output based on QSAR features for predicitve purposes (predicting_path)
